# PureEdgeSim_Fuzzy_Logic_Example
A Fuzzy Logic based workload orchestration example

 In this example we show how to implement a Fuzzy Logic based orchestration algorithm, we tried to implement this algorithm but with a little
 modification in order to support mist computing (computing at the extreme edge). The algorithm can be found in this paper here:
 
 C. Sonmez, A. Ozgovde and C. Ersoy, "Fuzzy Workload Orchestration for Edge
 Computing," in IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management, vol. 16,
 no. 2, pp. 769-782, June 2019.
 
 To use it you must download JFuzzy_Logic jar file from here
 http://jfuzzylogic.sourceforge.net/html/index.html
 
 
 To run this example, you need to download [PureEdgeSim](https://github.com/CharafeddineMechalikh/PureEdgeSim)
 Then, place this example within the PureEdgeSim/ folder and you are ready to start.
